Ayy
Ayy, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
Oh, oh, oh
The way we move, uh, skin on to skin
No separation, need no competition, na, na, na
Uh, on everything
It's automatic, goin' zero to a hun', na, na
Ridin', wishin' the wheels will fall off
Time is tickin', it's takin' you too long
Ride before I decide to go home
Act like you heard me
Only serve it up if you deserve me, yeah
Pull up and earn me (pusha, pusha)
Push to start (pusha, pusha)
Act like you heard me
Only serve it up if you deserve me, yeah
Pull up and earn me (pusha, pusha)
Push to start (pusha, pusha)
Mum, pushin' on my buttons with no hesitation ('tation)
Gas me up, give me motivation ('vation)
So tell me where we goin', pick a destination ('nation)
Gas me up, give me motivation now ('vation)
Pushin' on my buttons with no hesitation ('tation)
Gas me up, give me motivation ('vation)
So tell me where we goin', pick a destination ('nation)
Gas me up, give me motivation now (nah)
Come give me life, and I'll change yours
Who needs signs? I say floor it
On a highway, we load it
Hold me, load me, hold me
Act like you heard me
Only serve it up if you deserve me, yeah
Pull up and earn me (pusha, pusha)
Push to start (pusha, pusha)
Act like you heard me
Only serve it up if you deserve me, yeah
Pull up and earn me (pusha, pusha)
Push to start (pusha, pusha)
Mum, pushin' on my buttons with no hesitation ('tation)
Gas me up, give me motivation ('vation)
So tell me where we goin', pick a destination ('nation)

Give me life, I'll change yours
Who needs signs? I say floor it

Oh, oh, oh
